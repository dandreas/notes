For the test:
Aperature:      f/2     2.8     4       5.6     8       11      16      22      32
How wide open the lens is (big to small O to o)
Less in focus > more in focus
Brighter > Darker
Shutter Speed:  1.2s    1/4     1/8     1/15    1/30    1/60    1/125   1/250   1/500
How long the shutter is open
Slow(blur) > Fast(stop action)
Brighter > Darker
ISO:            100     200     400     800     1600    3200    6400    12800   25600
Sensitivity to light
Crisp > Grainy
Brighter > Darker

Depth of Field:
    Aperature (Higher aperature, more depth of field)
    Camera to subject distance
    Focal length (length of the lens)

Jpeg vs RAW
    jpegs are smaller (4x)
    raw are easier to edit
    jpegs are toned by default (usually)
    raws are not, which makes them easier to edit

sRGB vs AdobeRGB
    They are colour profiles
    safest bet: sRGB
        it's widely supported

    AdobeRGB has a larger colour profile
    if you shoot in AdobeRGB, and you don't convert it to sRGB in photoshop before publishing it, the photo will look washed out
    it's used for professional prints to get better pictures

Histogram
    A graphical representation of all of the pixels in your photograph
    (the indicator on the camera is an easy-to-read histogram)

Digital workflow
    Be organized
        Sort photographs on your computer by year/date/shoot
    When you're removing pictures off of your camera, make sure to format your card from the camera
        this makes your sd cards last longer
    Backup your photos!
