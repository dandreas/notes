Ch 5:
Probability Distribution of a Discrete RV:
    Determining if it is:
        0 <= P(x) <= 1
        summation(P(x)) == 1

The mean of a probability Distribution of a discrete RV is (mew) and the variance is (sigma)^2
    (sigma)^2 = summation(x^2 * P(x)) - (mew)^2
    (mew) = summation(x) * P(x)
        round to 1 decimal more than the values of x, unless you need more decimals to get to 1 significant figure

5.3 The Binomial Probability Distribution: A special discrete Probability distribution, it results from a procedure that meets all of the folowing requirements.
    1. The procedure has a fixed number of trials
    2. The trials are independent
    3. Each trial has an outcome in one of two disjoint categories that are referred to as: Success or Failure.
        3.1. They cannot overlap!
    4. The probability of success remains the same in each trial
    E: p(x) = n!/((n-x)!*x!) * p^x * q^(n-x)
        where:
            n = # of trials
            x = # of successes among n trials
            p = probability of success in any one trial
            q = probability of failure in any one trial (q = 1 - p)

Parameters of a binomial distribution
Mean: M = n*p
Variance (o^2) = npq
Standard Deviation: (o) = sqrt(npq)

CH 6:
y = (e^(-1/2*(x*m/S)^2))/S * (sqrt(2 * pi)

CH 7:
mew(p-hat) = mew = n*p
sigma(p-hat)^2 = p*q/n
