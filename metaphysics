&1Logic: key to finding wisdom
    Terms and distinctions
    Truth
    Validity

&1What is naturalism?
    Williamson: There is only the natural world, and the best way to find out about it is the scientific method.
        2 parts:
            there is only the nartual world (metaphysical)
            the best way to find out about it is the scientific method (epistemological)
    Rosenberg: the philosophical theory that treats science as our most reliable source of knowledge and the scientific method is the most effective route
        1 part:
            the scientific method is the best source of knowledge (epist)
Monism
    &1Ontological: only one kind of being (material/natural)
    &1Explanitory: only one kind of explanation (natural/scientific)

Objections to Naturalism
    Mathematics yields knowledge without using the scientific method
        If naturalism is true then math does not yield knowledge
        Therefore: Naturalism is false
    Dillema:
        If science is defined inclusively, naturalism loses its bite
        If science is defined exclusively, then it loses credibility
        => Either naturalism loses its bite or loses credibility

Substance: entities that exist that are not properties
Property: a way something exists (a mode of existing)
    Physical properties: public, external, third-person
    Psychological properties: private,internal, first-person, intentionality
        sensations
        thoughts (true,false)
        intellectual agency
        moral agency

Intrinsic:
Formal causes: 
    explains what something is (substantial form)
    explains a resulting change (accidental form)
Material causes:
    explains what something is made of
Extrinsic:
Efficient cause:
    What acts to bring about the change or effect
Final cause:
    explains why a cause brings about a certain effect

purpose:
    organ transplants
Process:
    Uses stem cells, placed inside a pig/cattle embryo, to see if they integrate into the organism.
    Human cells have issues surviving in the blastocyst stage (before implantation)
    Human cells post implantation will often retard growth.
    Human stem cells will develop into various non-stem-cell type cells in the organisms.
The stem cells used are taken from adults, and genetically modified to 'think' they are stem cells. Source doesn't matter (usually).
Possible uses:
    Organs are your own, might not req medication.

The Challenge of Mr. Monteith:
    (talking about the difference between weight and mass)
    Since the universe has a beginning shouldn't it have a cause?
        His answer: The universe is eternal and cyclical (oscillating)
Temporal vs causal priority:
    Temporal priority: relation in time
    Causal priority: relation in form of cause (not necessarily in time)
        causes can be simultaneous (author poses all causation as simultaneous)
    Options for causation:
        Beginning:      *------>
        Eternal:        <------>
        (non-beginning)  /<-\ 
                        (    )
                         \->/ 
            Must there be a first cause in the eternal?
            (premise) That the entire universe is an instance of circular [simultaneous] causation is impossible
                case: if you have a chandelier with an infinitely long chain, it would not be able to hang unless 
                    it were supported by something else

Basic argument
    Assume there are more than one first cause
        There must be a distinction between the two
        This requires a cause
    Falsehood or absurdity
        So they are not first causes
    So, deny assumption

Lesson of the Snowball
    All composition requires a cause.
