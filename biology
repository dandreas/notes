How do we define life?
    Living things:
        are organized
        acquire materials and energy
        respond
        reproduce and develop
        have adaptations

Organisms - Organised
Living things are very diverse
Emergent properties: The whole is more than the sum of its parts
    Progression from: Atom -> Molecule -> Cell -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ System -> Organism

Living Things Acquire Material and Energy
    &1Energy: needed to maintain organization
    &1Metabolism: chemical reactions in a cell
    Photosynthesis is key
    Homeostasis

Living Things Respond (to their environment)
    Interact with environment
        Sense things
        React
        Often can move

Living Things Reproduce and Develop
    All living things can make more of themselves
        Pass on genes to the next generation
        Simple organisms split in two
        Multicellular organisms more complex
            Immature stage gradually develops to adult

Living Things Have Adaptations
    Modifications that make them better able to survive in an environment
    Life is diverse because organisms adapt
    &1Evolution: Populations of organisms changing over time to become more suited to their environment

Evolution, the Unifying Concept
    Even though organisms are diverse they still:
        Have DNA
        Similar cells
        Same metabolic reactions
    Evolution explains many aspects of biology

Natural Selection
    Environment selects traits more apt to be passed on
        Can be a biotic or abiotic factor
    Mutation can be important

Organizing Diversity
    &1Taxonomy: Identifying and grouping organisms
    Makes sense of diversity
    Insight into evolution
        Domain > Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order > Family > Genus > Species

Kingdoms
    Eukarya
        Protista
        Fungi
        Plantae
        Animalia

Scientific Names
    Binomial nomenclature
        Genus species
            Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer)
    In Latin because it is a universal language (also it is a dead one)

(09112017)
How the Biosphere is Organized
    Organism > Population > Community > Ecosystem > Biosphere

The Human Population    
    Humans have a major impact on ecosystem processes
        Destroy habitat
        Pollute
        Alter nutrient cycles

Biodiversity
    &1Biodiversity: Total number, relative abundance of species, their genetic variability, and the number of ecosystems in which they live
        15m species
    Extinction: death of a species
        400 a day
    Damaging ecosystems causes problems
        Draining wetlands, cutting down rain forests
    Preserving biodiversity is a challenge

The Process of Science
    Bioogy is the scientific study of life
    Scientific Method
      Standard series of steps to gain knowledge
        Observation
            New observations are made, and previous data are studied.
        Hypothesis
            Input from various sources is used to formulate a testable statement
        Experiment/Observations
            The hypothesis is tested by experiment or further observations.
        Conclusion
            The results are analyzed, and the hypothesis is supported or rejected.
        Scientific Theory
            Many experiments and observations support a theory.

Observation
    A scientist observes something, gets idea for experiment, or more observations
        Observe directly
        Get idea from another scientist
    Example:
        "Marauders wear eye patches"

Hypothesis
    After observation, hypothesis is generated
        An educated guess
    &1Deductive reasoning: "if", "then" reasoning

Experiment/ Further Observations
    &1Experimental Variable(Independent Variable): Factor of the experiment being tested
    &1Responding Variable(Dependent Variable): Result or change that occurs due to the experimental variable
    &1Experimental Design: Methods to conduct a study
        Most have a control group

Data
    The results of experiment
    Often numerical, use stats to draw conclusions
        Average time to complete course
        Compare groups using a statistical test
Conclusion
    Data analysis is used to reach a conclusion
    Is the hypotheisis supported or not
    Conclusions from one experiment can lead to another hypothesis

Scientific Theory
    Goal to understand natural world in terms of scientific theory
        Supported by a variety of observations, data, and experiments
    Biological theories:
        Cell
        Gene
        Evolution

Chemical Elements
    &2Matter: anything that takes up space and has mass
    &2Element: Can't break down into simpler substance
    &2Proton: Positive charge, found in nucleus
    &2Neutron: No charge, found in nucleus
    &2Electron: Negative charge, found in electron shell
Atomic Number and Mass Number
    &2Atomic Number: number of protons
    &2Mass Number: protons + neutrons
